-The aim of this survey is to evaluate the research methods used in Geofencing and its associated design and methodology. In doing so the survey will consider the researchapproaches used by other developers in this field before adopting an approach. Once this is done the developer will justify why the selected approach has been adopted and should be used in preference to others. However, before this is done it is necessary to restate the variables that are under consideration as the variables that are to be collected decide what kind of method is used and why. It is also necessary to restate the methods used in collecting our data which were by observation in a developing stage and by problematic. These two methods of collection are the justification of how we collected our data and why those research methods had to be used. According to social scientist’s research design is the science and art of planning procedures for conducting studies so as to get the most valid findings as such this survey is key to validating our research findings.

<h2>SO first of all, what is Geofencing??? </h2>

-Geo-fencing (geofencing) is a great feature in a software program that uses Global Positioning System (GPS) or radio frequency identification (RFID) to define the geographical boundaries feature. Actually, geofence is a virtual barrier, it is an innovative technology, an online marketplace for proactive contextual services that allows users to easily find interesting services, can easily subscribe to it and to allow providers offer their services for a variety of applications such as electronic toll collection, contextual advertising or tourist information systems, even without additional infrastructure. The main objective of this research was to understand how the use of spatial data can improve advertising performance for customers. Tracking systems and monitoring, based on global navigation services by satellite, and include geofencing functions, could also contribute to the exact location of an institution or company and increase sales and business perspective efficiently. Instead of large billboards they can now advertise on smartphones which are economically and accurately tested.
-A geofence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area. It can be a radius around a location or a predefined set of boundaries. With Plot Researches you can create Geofences with a radius of between 50 to 50,000 meters. The process of using a geofence is called geofencing. Geofencing allows you to send notifications to your app users when they are in the vicinity of, for example, your store. A geofencing is a virtual barrier program that allows an administrator to set up triggers when a device enters (or exits) the boundaries defined by the administrator so that a text message or email alert can be sent. Geofencing is a technology used to monitor mobile objects (vehicles, persons, containers…), located by GPS. The geographic coordinates of the tracked object are automatically and regularly sent to a control center, via mobile phone networks (Allomone, 2011). Referring from the above research works a new use of geofencing can be in historical and archaeological sites for the purpose of guiding the tourists when they reach the site.
Geofencing Techniques Geofencing can be of benefit in numerous domains and has many functions: the monitoring of mobile assets and people within geographical areas. Various geofencing techniques have been developed to meet different pragmatic needs. The main techniques are presented below Geofenced Area This technique provides automatic monitoring of mobile objects moving around or inside a geofenced area. Alarms are generated when mobiles respectively enter or exit the boundary. The size of the area can range from a few tens of meters to several kilometers. The shape of the geofencing can be a simple geometric figure, like square or rectangle, or a more complicated one, like a complex polygon.

Who and how Geofencing technology is used in the market??

    • Uber. At the moment, Uber uses geofencing at LAX almost as a defensive measure. 
    • Walmart. Walmart's app has a Store Mode that, amongst other things, responds to geofencing around stores, and delivers coupons and e-receipts. ...
    • The British Open Golf Championships. – for tracking location of golf ball
    • Starbucks. – locations for their franchise
    • Honeywell's smart thermostats. ...
    • Amazon – for deliver services and store location

Only 2-3 applications are there for security but how do they work??

    • The camera industries that detects that if any one goes into kitchen or elsewhere
    • The weather industries that detects that if any cyclone or not
    • There are many more examples to give but till date no one has focused in the medical area for using this geofencing technology.

<p align="justify">
As you can see in the above prototype, how the application tracks the user's location and finds whether the user is in danger (Here danger means infected [by virus or infection ] which is harmful to human beings) zone/area or not.
As you can see in another image you will see posts that are made live it’s realtime post ,also other users will be given privileges to post the live action for the danger zone..
There are many such features to talk about ,But be patient the application will blast your mind.

This project is aimed at developing an Android application for security purposes. In the existing system every work is done manually and also application data is maintained in a secure system. Maintaining and managing a large amount of data is a difficult task. So, to overcome the drawbacks of the existing system the proposed system is developed. The features included in the proposed system are:
</p>
    • It provides an easy way for the application to get users current details to provide accurate data.
    • users will receive notification about any danger to them in any how the situation.
    • This app manages all data regarding location, user info and nothing else.
    • This app also gets the information of what’s happening in your surroundings and also provides news.
    • This system can save time and effort.
